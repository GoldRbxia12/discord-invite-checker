# Discord Invite Checker (Custom Config)

A customizable tool to filter and validate Discord invites based on configured criteria.

## üîß Configuration

### 1. `config.json`
This file controls the invite filtering criteria. Modify the file to suit your requirements:
```json
{
  "minBoost": 0,             // Minimum server boosts
  "minOnlineMembers": 51,    // Minimum number of online members
  "minMembers": 150,         // Minimum total members
  "maxMembers": 750000       // Maximum total members
}
```

### 2. `invites.txt`
This file should contain the invite codes (one per line) that you want to validate. **Only include the invite code, not the full URL.**

Example:
```
abcdef
ghijkl
mnopqr
```

### 3. `excluded.txt`
This file allows you to specify invite codes that should be excluded from validation. Any invite codes listed here will be skipped, and the exclusion will be logged in the console.

Example:
```
abcdef
mnopqr
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Ensure the required files (`config.json`, `invites.txt`, and optionally `excluded.txt`) are set up in the same directory as the script.

2. Run the script using Node.js:
```bash
node index.js
```

## üìÑ Outputs

- **Real-time Logs**: The console will display the progress of invite validation, including duplicates, exclusions, and matches.
- **Valid Invites**: All valid invites that meet the criteria in `config.json` will be saved to `output.txt`.

Example of console output:
```
Loaded 100 invites (70 unique, 5 excluded).
| Invite: 5/70 checking | Duplicate: 30 | Excluded: 5 | Valid: 0 | Matched: 0
Saved 10 valid invites to "output.txt".
```
